# FileM0ver
FileM0ver is a C# utility program that can move files to their own folder based on a Regex pattern. This was made for an specific use and won't probably become a general-purpose tool.

## Why won't this become a general purpose tool?
As I said, it's made for a very specific purpose. There are some hardcoded bits and some messy parts that need comments.

# Compiling
You will need:
* Visual Studio 2019
* C# development workload
* .NET Framework 4.7.2

Should be very straightforward from that point on.
